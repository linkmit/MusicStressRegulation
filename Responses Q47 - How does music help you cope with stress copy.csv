"Question: If you listen to music to cope with stress, how do you experience this helping you? "
Focusing on the melody and lyrics helps me take my mind away from my ruminating thoughts.
"I usually listen to the lyrics a lot which brings me to a different train of thought and make me feel more relaxed and joyful (depending on the type of music). A lot of the times I feel it in my body, I become more energised and hyped or sometimes more mindful and calm"
It's usually calming to listen to music I already know.
"Most of the time when I listen to music is to remind myself to breathe in and out. Put myself out of the body tension when feeling very stressed. I usually clench my jaw and that turns out in pain that spreads to be a migraine, so listening to some music helps me realize what I’m doing"
"I listen to music when I am on a walk on before falling asleep, this results in day dreaming thereby drifting off and getting distracted from current worries. "
"depending on my mood, the music calms me down or energises me out of the stress. it can help me sleep sometimes"
It helps to relax and calm down
It lowers my stress levels
Forget bout stress or the problems
It makes me feel more at ease/understood. 
The music helps distract me from what I am stressed about and calms down my mind. It can also reassure me that I don’t need to be so stressed and that I can achieve what I am trying to do. Sometimes I choose songs which have lyrics or instrumentals that will motivate me and other times I choose songs with lyrics or instrumentals that reflect how I am feeling. 
"It helps me to live through the emotions 'better' once I find a piece that is similar to the mood I am currently experiencing, 'aggravating' effect if you may. Otherwise, sometimes it helps to reminisce, either to tie the current situation to certain periods in life when I felt something similar, or generally to remember the times associated with a specific song/album. I cannot say that I am fully relaxed in the end if I am too stressed, but rather feel more connected to what is currently happening.

There are times, of course, when I just feel too overwhelmed to listen to anything, but certain ASMR content (even something as simple as white noise) helps me to ground myself."
"I listen to fast music because it fits with my mood, idk if it is helping but it fits how I feel"
"When I come back from my studies, I’m sometimes pretty stressed and irritated about things I don’t understand yet, things that are still unclear, or classmates who don’t have their stuff together. That’s when I like to put on some angry, rage-type music and just scream along. It lets me blow off steam without taking it out on my project partners."
"As a musician, when I listen to music I can focus on the different compositional elements, lyrics, song structure etc. This helps me to focus my thoughts on one thing rather than being overwhelmed by many thoughts of school and life. Music that I really like can help me to process my emotions as well, especially when they are reflected in the lyrics or tone of the song."
It serves as a distraction and as a way to channel my emotions into an external source outside my body. It calms me.
It’s very relaxing and allows me to forget about stressors temporarily 
"Takes my mind off whatever is stressing me out. Sometimes it helps to concentrate. But I don't just listen, I make music as well. It help help to focus on learning something that is inherently different from course work, or to play something that is easy and familiar. "
Just calming and clearing my mind because it distracts me a little and I can get lost in it
"Folk music manages to call me down, and I listen to metal to drown out the stress"
My favourite songs give me a happiness boost 
It gives me something to focus on
Calming effect
"What helps is hearing someone express their frustration about the same situation I am in too in a song. I look up my situation on Spotify or Youtube, for example 'Burnout,' and listen to the selected songs."
It occupies your mind with something else
As a distraction and/or to force my thoughts to slow down by canceling out a second stream of thoughts by replacing it with music.
"It gives my mind something to run to, not really a distraction but something that cancels out silence and is both familiar and repetitive enough to soothe "
"Whenever I have had a busy day at university, I always plug in my earphones in the train and listen to my regular playlist. It always makes me just sit back and let my thoughts/imagination run at its natural pace, which helps distract me from day to day problems/things that are out of my control and sink into my inner world. "
Music helps me to calm and motivate myself and escape from stressful situations
achieving a mental resonance with lyrics and/or focusing on music to either intensify my emotions or distract myself from them
"As someone who listens to music almost all the time, when I’m stressed it helps me by giving my brain something familiar to follow without visual stimulation. "
"It takes away the focus of my own thoughts, and provides comfort."
"Music does not really relieve my stress, but it offers a nice distraction. "
Helps me focus and ground better by just simply taking away one of my senses from the outside world
Taking my mind off things and just following the rhythm 
"I often listen to music that makes me feel peaceful, I close my eyes and try to breath calmly, imagining my safe space where the stress cannot reach me. Other times I go on a long walk (or a shorter one, if there’s not enough time) always with my headphones - at those times it’s often more energetic music that helps me feel the stress leaving my body when dancing/running/weird(but effective movements :)"
Music either gets my mind quiet for a while (which I'm always looking for but especially in times of stress) or gets me emotional enough that I can cry my stress out
"Helps me escape from the moment and relax. It aids me into daydreaming and picture myself elsewhere, and forget about the causes of my stress. On the other hand, it may also act as a soundtrack to my current circumstance, helping me envision my situation through a cinematic lens and see I as entertainment rather than stress."
I can focus better when I listen to music. It also helps me sleep
Distraction
It can calm me down or regulate my mood according to the 'feeling' of the song.
If I think I'm going to be late to an appointement I listen to Brazilian MPB or classical music so I can get lost in them and not worry about something out of my control (how fast the bus is going) and I just enjoy the music
"It distracts inner monologue, changes the vibe with happy music or gives undetstood feeling with not-happy music"
"overall influence on mood, which consequently also helps with stress"
I guess that listening to music makes me more relaxed and it takes my mind off the things I’m stressed about.
"It helps me to shake the stress off, meaning that my mind is elsewhere so I dont feel this feeling of pressure in my body, or i dont perform the habits that i have listed. I feel less tense so my head doesnt hurt or i dont have a need to sleep. I m full of energy when im not under stress, however it does help me sometimes to finish my work before deadline."
"When I get stressed about anything I like to put on noise canceling headphones and play music as loud as possible and concentrate on the lyrics or the music itself as to distract myself from my thoughts. It usually helps me calm down and focus on the task at hand. Usually after I’ve calmed down I let the music play (a little less loud) and try to refocus on the task - or going to sleep.
The scenario stated also usually is connected to me not being able to fall asleep without music or noise since my thoughts just overwhelm me "
"It takes my mind off whatever I'm stressed about. I like to focus on the lyrics or sing/hum along to become more immersed.
It can also give me a lot of energy, or console me in some way."
When I am very stressed or experience high emotions I will often sing along to music that I know really well. It kind of helps drowning out the stress and creates a bit more distance
"It usually takes one of two forms: either I listen to something low-key (such as lofi) that I subconsciously listen to and is simply good for getting into a rhythm, or specifically choose an album that I enjoy so that I can focus upon the quality of the music (and thereby not on what's stressing me)."
I listen to Animal Crossing soundtrack (pomodoro) on YouTube while studying for exams to reduce exam season stress :D
"I recognize my own feelings in the music. And it just generally gives me a good feeling when I listen to music, a feeling hard to describe"
Energise myself to continue or get out of bed. Sooth my negative thoughts. Stimulate dopamine production.
Running with my spotify music 
It gives me an outlet in which I can escape but also soemtimes offers me perspective on my own experiences.
I like to listen to music that is as noisy as possible when I’m stressed so it just fills my brain completely. I need metal or hard rock. Just lots of instruments at full volume and screaming vocals. This just filters out my stress voices
"it works relaxing, I'm not overthinking anymore"
Makes me forget about the “real” and helps me shift my focus away from my tasks for a while
"Usually to distract me from my (stressful) thoughts, so like a form of procrastination."
"I mostly select depending on my mood, but there’s no consistency. So if I’m stressed there’s not one particular kind of music i listen to, just whatever works for mu brain in that moment. "
It calms my mind and through that it eventually calms my body 
"Distraction, mood uplifting"
"Certain songs help me calm down when the stress causes me to feel anxious or overwhelmed, they help me breathe and feel connected to my body. Other songs kickstart my brain into doing something productive which makes me less stressed"
"I sing along and it calms me because I know that whatever happens I can always turn back this song and find myself through it. Instead of think about the future and everything going wrong I focus on the song, both on the lyrics and melody."
"If i feel sad music can help or if im angry, but not necessarily with stress, I think I avoid music when I’m stressed bc I have adhd so it makes it worse "
"When I'm feeling really stressed or really overstimulated, I either listen to my favorite songs (which calms me down instantly) or I listen to music that you could categorize as 'chill' music. With that I mean music that is not too all over the place, and just eases your mind. In my case, it's folk music from the 60s, which is often just singing and guitar strumming. It takes my mind off of the thing I'm so stressed about for a moment, so it's actually more like a temporary distraction than an actual solution lol. "
When Im low energy/pessimistic mood I listen to Sabrina Carpenter/Chappel Roan/Olivia Rodrigo and get hyped up. And when I need to chill out/ focus I listen to classical soundtracks of my favourite films (think Ghibli or Star Wars).
"For a get-away to not think. Or, that it’s just life. (Listening mainly to Frank Turner, has great songs of just living your life and making the best of it with ya friends)"
I try to use the music to guide myself to a less stressful memory and through that to a better mindset
"I mostly stress because of my own procrastination issues, so putting on music often helps me get started (helps me overcoming the hurdle of starting a task) but it becomes too distracting if the songs have lyrics so just instrumental music it is!"
"Can be in different ways - either listening to calming, sad or flowy music to get me out of it, or especially frantic sounds to sychronize with and validate my state of mind, which then  gives some grip on the spiral"
I dance to it or it helps me take my mind of my stressful thoughts 
It helps as a distraction from stress. When im stressed about uni I listen to music to relax
"i find my emotions and experiences reflected in music, so listening helps to not feel alone"
"
Music quiets the voices in my head that are stuck on the topic that causes stress"
Music lets me isolate from the world for some time. I enjoy the emotions that derive from it and then I start again what I need to do
"Sometimes to feel calm and peace and to know that my current situation isn't as bad as I make it out to be, sometimes to give me energy or help me stay focused"
Just stress relief
I listen to Animal Crossing soundtrack (pomodoro) on YouTube while studying to reduce the stress from studying :D
Whenever I'm having anxiety
It feels like exhaling after holding in your breath too long. I love putting on a vinyl record after work/school because my mind can focus on the music and relax
"When I’m stressed I put on relaxing music to calm myself, also I like to play melancholic music which sometimes makes me even more nervous .😀"
Going for a walk or when going home or to uni 
Dancing to throw the stress out of my body
"When I feel stressed, listening to music or podcasts helps me to distract myself and ignore and reduce the bodily and mental effects stress has on me. When I'm stressed my heart rate goes up, I feel dissociated and start to hyperventilate, so when I listen to music these effects are reduced because the music distracts me and sometimes also makes me happy"
"De muziek die ik luister wanneer ik gestresst ben, kalmeert me, zorgt ervoor dat de rest van mijn gedachtes stil blijven en dat de prikkels om mij heen minder hard of niet binnenkomen. "
"It reminds me that I have a strong and attainable passion (making music, that is), which helps me ground myself and feel more confident. In addition, listening to music I know well and/or to very chaotic music can help me distract myself from the source of the stress. Listening to music also helps me relax my body, especially when I turn it up to a high volume."
"If I'm nervous because of a specific reason, I use it as a distraction. If I'm just generally stressed, I use it to calm down"
It helps me to focus and ignore the stress around me - it overshadows my stressful thoughts.
"I use music mainly to distract myself from overthinking about stressors. For example, when I am studying for an exam, trying to sleep, or dancing."
It relaxes me
"Depends on the situation, sometimes I prefer some slower music to calm down my nerves and breathing, while other times I prefer some dance songs to dance the stress away"
