How I feel?\nHow I feel? I wanna keel\nOver harder than a turned-up challenger\nI wanna keep all of your charm in a canister\nDo you inspire like the same did Salinger?\nI'm the pig on the Chinese calendar\nI got a shadow like a .58 Calibre\nI wanna move like a new Salamander\nI love the carrion who's a real Scavenger\nIt's moral tyranny keeping me from thee\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Bridge]\nHit me for the day\nFor the light that you suffered\nTo come by, take to my sky\nNever wanting, only wonder\nTo live out of reach\nSloping family, short to tall\nOne to three, swallow the key\nIn their footprints, I will follow\n\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm gon' hit your business if it's momentary blissness, uhh\nI'm gon' hit your business if it's momentary blissness, uhh\nI'm gon' hit your business if it's momentary blissness, uhh\nI'm gon' hit your business if it's momentary blissness, uhh",

    "lyrics": "[Intro]\nSeparate faces help him to walk and cross the tiles\nAs he justifies existence with flinches and false smiles\nAnd the hand he used to feed his hunger shriveled from the cold\nHe's borrowed more than he can pay, his debts are getting old\nThe cracks had always been on show, the spirit always broke\nThe bottle always emptied well before the candles smoked\nTobacco always there on cue in someone else's glass\nSomeone else's secrets become someone else's path\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI know you well, I know you felt\nLike it should've been someone else who fell\nBut I'll never forget your face\nYou melt into my life\n\n[Verse 1]\nI want the attention that she's getting\nFrom your loving arms\nYou let me soak your face into my memory\nLike you want me, and you carry me\nWanting more as I don't know you\nI don't own you, I just sew you\nInto pieces of this fabric that I wear over my shoulder\n\n[Verse 2]\nLike a dream, you fill me up\nAnd make me cold, just like a soldier\nTrains her mind to do the killing\nEven though he isn't willing\nI have pain, and I am cold\nWithout your heat to make me bold\nJust forget that we're not molded\nWe're just solitary soldiers\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nGiven up on all this love stuff\nIt's made up and we're just older\nI give up on you, we're over\nI want reciprocal lovers\nI want trust, and I want safety\nI want space, and I need chasing\nI want to feel that I'm the only girl\nAround you who can know you\n\n[Verse 4]\nBut I want to see you luring\nOther women who can't own you\nI want to see their faces\nWhen you make them lose their graces\nWhen you make them feel they're placeless\nLike a chain around an object that keeps moving\nYou're a concept of a man and of an object\n\n[Verse 5]\nYou are everything I wanted\nAll I seem to crave\nLike a hero needs to save\nExcept when I get up close\nThere is a maggot on the rose\nLike a magpie stealing shiny things\nThere's sometimes diamonds, sometimes tin\n\n\n[Chorus 2]\nYou are my darkness, and you understand\nI don't want anything but your hand\nJust hold me steady, hold the frame\nAnd I'll shoot again now\n\n[Verse 6]\nI can't stop thinking about you\nAnd if you're stripping me down to\nMy brittle bones and crumbled joints\nThese open wounds just need some salt\nOh, it would be better if you left\nIf I can't see you, I can't step\nInto the light you've cast about you\nI can't have you, but I want you\n[Chorus 3]\nThis obsession is not letting me slide\nI feel I'm damaging myself to stay alive\nI am destroying all I have to let this burn\nThis little flame is not so dangerous on its own",

    "lyrics": "[Intro: Deyra Barrera]\nQue reflejan tu mirada\nLa noche, tú y yo\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nI got this fire burnin' in me from within\nConcentrated thoughts on who I used to be, I'm sheddin' skin\nEvery day, a new version of me, a third of me demented, cemented in pain\nJuggling the pros and cons of fame\nI don't know how to make friends, I'm a lonely soul\nI recollect this isolation, I was four years old\nTruth be told, I've been battling myself\nTryna navigate the real and fake\nCynical about the judgement day\nI did past life regression last year and it fucked me up\nReincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus\nBody after body, lesson after lesson, let's take it back to Michigan in 1947\nMy father kicked me out the house 'cause I wouldn't listen to him\nI didn't care about his influence, only loved what I was doing\nGifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level\nThe most talented where I'm from, but I had to rebel\nAnd so I'm off in the sunset, searchin' for my place in the world\nWith my guitar up on my hip as the story unfurled\nI found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect\nWhile the record business loved me\nI was head of rhythm and blues\nThe women that fell to they feet, so many to choose\nBut I manipulated power as I lied to the masses\nDied with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated\n\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nAnother life had placed me as a Black woman in the Chitlin' Circuit\nSeductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains\nMy voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed\nA musical genius what the articles emphasized\nHad everything I wanted, but I couldn't escape addiction\nHeroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted\nTurned on my family, I went wherever cameras be\nCocaine, no private planes for my insanity\nSelf-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments\nI needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin\nFuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar\nSex and melodies gave me hope when nobody's lookin'\nMy first assistant was a small town scholar\nNever did a Quaalude 'til I got myself around her\nMy daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me\nI died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nMy present life is Kendrick Lamar\nA rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe\nThe only factor I respected was raisin' the bar\nMy instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh\nMy father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him\nI'm old enough to understand the way I was livin'\nEgo and pride had me looking at him with resentment\nI close my eyes, hoping that I don't come off contentious\nI'm yelling, \"Father, did I finally get it right?\" Everything I did was selfless\nI spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them\nI didn't gloat, even told 'em, \"No,\" when the vultures came\nTook control of my fleshly body when the money changed\nSon, you do well, but your heart is closed\nI can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself\nFather, I'm not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down\n\"But your pride has to die,\" okay, Father, show me how\nTell me every deed that you done and what you do it for\nI kept one hundred institutions paid\nOkay, tell me more\nI put one hundred hoods on one stage\nOkay, tell me more\nI'm tryna push peace in L.A. \nBut you love war\nNo, I don't\nOh, yes, you do\nOkay, then tell me the truth\nEvery individual is only a version of you\nHow can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?\nI could tell you where I'm going\nI could tell you who you are\nYou fell out of Heaven 'cause you was anxious\nDidn't like authority, only searched to be heinous\nIsaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent\nMy greatest music director was you\nIt was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues\nIt was harmony and motion\nI sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken\nRehabilitation, not psychosis\nBut now we here now\nCenturies you manipulated man with music\nEmbodied you as superstars to see how you moving\nYou came a long way from garnishing evilish views\nAnd all I ever wanted from you was love and approval\nI learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear\nThe more that word is diminished, the more it's not real\nThe more light that I can capture, the more I can feel\nI'm using words for inspiration as an idea\nSo can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted?\nI promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understanding\nFor every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?\nI vow my life just to live one in harmony now\nYou crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity\nAnd I'm ashamed that I ever created that enemy\nThen let's rejoice where we at\nI rewrote the devil's story just to take our power back, 'carnated",

Herring]\nBut what was I to do?\nJust couldn't help myself falling in love with you\nAnd what could I say?\nOh, if I had another chance\nTo make you stay\nCause when you ran away\nI knew just what you were thinking that day\nYou just didn't love me like I do\nLike I love you\nThe sad thing is we're better off this way\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Samuel T.

I'm like a teenage girl\nI might as well write all over my notebook\nThat you \"rock my world\"\nBut you do, you really do\nYou've turned me upside down\nAnd that's okay, I'll let it happen\n'Cause I like having you around\nI'm electric, a romantic cliché\nYeah, they really are all true\nWhen we catch eyes at that stupid party\nI know exactly what to do\nI'll take your hand, and we will leave\nFrench exits from me and you\nAnd now I'm home, a little bit drunk\nSome things don't change\nAnd I know now\n\n\n[Chorus]\nMe and you were meant to be\nIn love\nMe and you were meant to be\nIn love\nMe and you\n\n[Outro]\nI see the signs of a lifetime, you till I die",

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHave you ever met a girl that you tried to date\nBut a year to make love she wanted you to wait?\nLet me tell a story of my situation\nI was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation\nThe way that I met her was on tour, at a concert\nShe had long hair and a short miniskirt\nI just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat\nI was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met\nI whispered in her ear, \"Come to the picture booth\nSo I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof\"\nI asked her her name, she said: \"Blah-blah-blah\"\nShe had 9/10 pants and a very big bra\nI took a couple of flicks and she was enthused\nI said: \"How do you like the show?\" She said: \"I was very amused\"\nI started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range\nBut when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange\nThen when I asked, \"Do ya have a man?\", she tried to pretend\nShe said: \"No, I don't, I only have a friend\"\nCome on! I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing\n\n[Chorus]\nYou, you got what I need\nBut you say he's just a friend\nAnd you say he's just a friend, oh baby\nYou got what I need\nBut you say he's just a friend\nBut you say he's just a friend, oh baby\nYou got what I need\nBut you say he's just a friend\nBut you say he's just a friend\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I took blah-blah's word for it at this time\nI thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime\n'Cause I have friends and that's a fact\nLike Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack\nForget about that, let's go into the story\nAbout a girl named \"blah-blah-blah\" that adored me\nSo we started talkin', gettin' familiar\nSpendin' a lot of time, so we can build a\nRelationship or some understanding\nHow it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'\nEverything sounded so dandy and sweet\nI had no idea I was in for a treat\nAfter this was established, everything was cool\nThe tour was over and she went back to school\nI called every day to see how she was doin'\nEvery time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'\nI called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again\nI say: \"Yo, who was that?\" \"Oh, he's just a friend\"\nDon't gimme that, don't even gimme that!\nJus' bust this\n\n[Chorus]\nYou, you got what I need\nBut you say he's just a friend\nAnd you say he's just a friend, oh baby\nYou got what I need\nBut you say he's just a friend\nBut you say he's just a friend, oh baby\nYou got what I need\nBut you say he's just a friend\nBut you say he's just a friend\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo, I came to her college on a surprise visit\nTo see my girl, that was so exquisite\nIt was a school day, I knew she was there\nThe first semester of the school year\nI went to a gate to ask where was her dorm\nThis guy made me fill out a visitor's form\nHe told me where it was and I was on my way\nTo see my baby doll, I was happy to say\nI arrived in front of the dormitory\n\"Yo, could you tell me where is door three?\"\nThey showed me where it was for the moment\nI didn't know I was in for such an event\nSo, I came to her room and opened the door\nOh, snap! Guess what I saw?\nA fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth\nI was so in shock, my heart went down south\nSo please, listen to the message that I send\nDon't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend...",

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLooking at it now\nIt all seems so simple\nWe were lying on your couch\nI remember\nYou took a Polaroid of us\nThen discovered (Then discovered)\nThe rest of the world was black and white\nBut we were in screaming color\nAnd I remember thinkin'\n\n[Chorus]\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n(Are we out of the woods?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLooking at it now\nLast December (Last December)\nWe were built to fall apart\nAnd fall back together (Back together)\nOoh, your necklace hanging from my neck\nThe night we couldn't quite forget\nWhen we decided, we decided\nTo move the furniture so we could dance\nBaby, like we stood a chance\nTwo paper airplanes flying, flying, flying\nAnd I remember thinkin'\n\n\n[Chorus]\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n(Are we out of the woods?)\n\n[Bridge]\nRemember when you hit the brakes too soon?\nTwenty stitches in the hospital room\nWhen you started crying, baby, I did too\nBut when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you\nRemember when we couldn't take the heat?\nI walked out, I said, \"I'm settin' you free\"\nBut the monsters turned out to be just trees\nWhen the sun came up, you were lookin' at me\nYou were lookin' at me, oh, you were looking at me\n(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)\n(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)\nI remember\n(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)\n(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)\nOh, I remember\n\n\n[Chorus]\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good",

    "lyrics": "[Intro: Cleo Sol]\nThere's a war, there's a war\n\n[Verse 1: Little Simz]\nThe kingdom's on fire, the blood of a young messiah\nI see sinners in a church, I see sinners in a church\nSometimes I might be introvert\nThere's a war inside, I hear battle cries\nMothers burying sons, young boys playing with guns\nThe devil's a liar, fulfil your wildest desires\nNow I don't wanna be the one to doctor this\nBut if you can't feel pain, then you can't feel the opposite\nThe fight between the Yin and Yang's a fight you'll never win\nI study humans, that makes me an anthropologist\nI'm not into politics, but I know it's dark times\nParts of the world still living in apartheid (Thеre's a war, there's a war)\nBut if I don't takе this winner's flight, that's career suicide\nThough I should've been a friend when your grandma died\nI see the illness eat my aunt laying in her bed\nI see her soul rising as her body gets closer to death\n\n[Refrain: Cleo Sol]\nFind a way, I'll find a way\nThe world's not over\nI will make it, don't you cry\nIn God we trust\n'Cause we're not alone\n\n\n[Verse 2: Little Simz & Cleo Sol]\nI need a licence to feel\nInternal wounds and I'm not tryna be healed (No, I don't, no, I don't)\nI sabotage what we are trying to build\n'Cause of feelings I keep inside, but it's time to reveal (Reveal, reveal)\nI hate the thought of just being a burden\nI hate that these conversations are surfaced\nSimz the artist or Simbi the person?\nTo you I'm smiling, but really, I'm hurting\nI dedicate my life and gave my heart over twenty-something years\nLeft wondering how I even feel\nBut was it even worth it?\nI bottle up and then spill it in verses\nOne day, I'm wordless, next day, I'm a wordsmith\nClose to success, but to happiness, I'm the furthest\nAt night, I wonder if my tears will dry on their own\nHoping I will fulfil Amy's purpose\nAngel said, \"Don't let you ego be a disturbance\"\nInner demon said, \"Motherfucker, you earned this\"\nLike they strip you of everything you're deserving\nRealise there is a prison in us, we are conditioned as fuck\nMan, it's like they can't sleep till our spirit is crushed\nHow much fighting must we do? We've been fearless enough\nAll we seen is broken homes here and poverty\nCorrupt government officials, lies, and atrocities\nHow they talking on what's threatening the economy?\nKnocking down communities to re-up on properties\nI'm directly affected, it does more than just bother me\nLook beyond the surface, don't just see what you wanna see\nMy speech ain't involuntary\nProjecting intentions straight from my lungs\nI'm a Black woman and I'm a proud one\nWe walk in blind faith not knowing the outcome\nBut as long as we're unified, then we've already won\n\n\n[Refrain: Cleo Sol]\nFind a way, I'll find a way\nThe world's not over\nI will make it, don't you cry\nIn God we trust\n'Cause we're not alone\n\n[Break]\nSometimes I can be introvert\nFeels like, feels like, feels like I can be introvert\nIntrovert\nFeels like, feels like, feels like I can be introvert\nSometimes I can be introvert\n[Outro: Emma Corrin]\nAnd so it begins\nThe base is an amalgamation of everything\nRules are not to be played by rebels\nThe story of never-ending\nYour introversion led you here\nIntuition protected you along the way\nFeelings allowed you to be well balanced\nAnd perspective gave you foresight\nThe top of the mountain is nothing without the climb\nOnly the strong will survive\nOnly the strong (Will survive)\nAlone, but not lonely\nYour truth unveils with time\nAs you embark on a journey\nOf what it takes to be a woman",

About to throw 'em away\nWith the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like OJ\nUsually I take them off with Oil of Olay\nEmcees is crabs in the barrel, pass the Old Bay\nHot as hell and it's a cold day, innit?\nWorking on a way that we can roll away tinted\nSome say the price of holding heat is often too high\nYou either be in a coffin or you be the new guy\nThe one that's too fly to eat shoo pie\n(Never too busy) Never too busy when it comes down to you and I\n(Swear to God) A lot of niggas wish to die\nThey need to hold their horses, there's bigger fish to fry\nYou're on the list, if not, pick a number spot\nTen and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumbaclaat\nI coulda had a V-8\nF-150 quad cab but I'll be straight\nMoney comes and goes like that two bit hussy\nThat night they tried to rush me – Dwight, pass the dutchie\nSo I can calm down, so they don't get it twisted\nTake it from the fireside, it won't get blistered\nGot it – what happened? Oh, it's not lit\nThese Metal Fingers be holding (Hot shit)\n\n\n[Verse 3: Count Bass D]\nWhen I was four, I penned \"God Was Born In New York\"\nBack in '77, still got nan in the crescent\nThe effervescence of God's presence is thick\nUnlike vapor, Esther Rolle, extra raw, word to the baker\nPeace to the hardworkin' gingerbread makers\nLooked her up and down, said, \"Hmm, too much makeup\"\nPoor music taste, ten years from being grown up\nRappers don't blow up, heads do (Aww, shit)\nMy name is Dwight Spitz, I'm a sonic addict\nI use to think it was merely a nagging habit\nBorn under a bad sign, I'm serious about this curse of mine\nI strive to flip it into fine wine\n\"Barely born a virgin\" is what the stars said\nBlack not white, red all over though, like Elmo\n28 years have passed, I feel I'm peaking\nI make music every weekend\nIt's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love\nI get mad love, but I detest the labor\nAnd its wages—you know, death?\nI'm servin' life from this gift of God\nDon't forget your potholders, my niggas\n\n[Outro: Dr. Dre]\n(More hot..)\n(More hot shit)\n(More hot shit)\nA short time later",

Were you a sleeper cell spy?\nIn fifty years, will all this be declassified?\nAnd you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, \"Good riddance\"\n'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden\nI would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside\nAnd you deserve prison, but you won't get time\nYou'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars\nYou crashed my party and your rental car\nYou said normal girls were boring\nBut you were gone by the morning\nYou kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing\n\n[Outro]\nAnd in plain sight you hid\nBut you are what you did\nAnd I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive\nThe smallest man who ever lived",

And what you did this for?\nShe said your body looks to me a way it never has before\nAnd is this what's making you so sad? And I can't do this anymore, and\n\n[Chorus]\nI found religion in a dirty bathroom stall\nIn the back of a liquor store in that mini-mall, and\nYou found religion when you realized you could fall\nNow you say that you've come far enough to give me a call\nSo you're calling now, but I lie, and I tell you that I've moved\n\n[Outro]\nEverything's brand, everything's brand\nEverything's brand\nEverything's brand, everything's brand\nEverything's brand new",

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen a fire starts in the hull, how much time do you have before it spreads to the deck?\nWhen a fire starts in the hull, how much time do you have before it spreads to the deck?\nMinutes? Hours? What time is it anyway?\nHow do you tell your family that you wanna quit school and just play with your band?\nWhen a fire starts burning, how much time do you have before it burns itself out?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd why do I feel like I'm choking lately? What am I doing here?\nWhy do I feel like I'm choking lately? What am I looking for?\nMaybe school, or maybe love, or maybe none of the above is the answer\nMaybe for once I'll really try, or fuck it all and just get high 'cause that's an answer\n\n[Verse 2]\nFeels like an answer\nAnd who do I wanna be?\nQuestion 23\nWhat's the furthest distance a ship can be from shore before it loses its signal?\nWhat's the furthest distance a ship can be from shore before it loses its signal?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd why do I feel like I'm choking lately? What am I doing here?\nWhy do I feel like I'm choking lately? What am I looking for?\nMaybe school, or maybe love, or maybe none of the above is the answer\nMaybe for once I'll really try, or fuck it all and just get high 'cause that's an answer\nThat's an answer\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nMaybe I'll practice my guitar, or read a book, or steal a car and steal the answer\nI'll get a job and I'll get paid or get a girlfriend and get laid and get the answer\nI'll join the army, go to war, give up my smokes, smoke some more\nI need an answer\nMove to the village, shave my head, wind up happy, wind up dead\nWind up in debt, wind up in love, or maybe none of the above is the answer\n\n[Verse 3]\nMaybe it's okay that I don't have a plan and I don't have a clue\nI'm 19 and that doesn't mean that I should know exactly what I want to do, right?\nI'm 19 and that doesn't mean that I should know what I want to do\nAnd I've got time to make mistakes, make up my mind\nAnd I've got time enough to find out all the answers\nBut I am scared and I'm afraid that a decision won't get made and I'll be like this forever\nI need help, need extra help, to find the answers, what's the answer?\nI don't know\n\n[Outro]\nI don't know\nI don't know\nI don't know\nI don't know\nI don't know\nI don't know\nI don't know\nI don't—I don't know\nWhen a fire starts in the hull, how much time do you have before it spreads to the deck?\nPencils down, papers turned over\nTime's up",

(¿Será?, ¿qué será?)\nQue no tiene certeza, y nunca te da (Y nunca te da)\nQue no tiene concepto, y nunca tendrá (Y nunca tendrá)\nQue no tiene tamaño\n\n\n[Verso 2]\nOh, ¿qué será?, ¿qué será?\nQue vive en las ideas de esos amantes\nQue cantan los poetas más delirantes\nY juran los profetas emborrachados\nEstá en la romería de los mutilados\nEstá en la fantasía de los infelices\nEstá en el día a día de las meretrices\nEn todos los bandidos y desvalidos\nEn todos sus sentidos, ¿será?, ¿qué será?

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe who's who of \"Who's that?\" is poised for the attack\nBut my bare hands paved their paths\nYou don't get to tell me about \"sad\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf you wanted me dead, you should've just said\nNothing makes me feel more alive\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street\nCrash the party like a record scratch as I scream\n\"Who's afraid of little old me?\"\nYou should be\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe scandal was contained\nThe bullet had just grazed\nAt all costs, keep your good name\nYou don't get to tell me you feel bad\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIs it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one morе joke\nThen we could all just laugh until I cry\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I lеap from the gallows and I levitate down your street\nCrash the party like a record scratch as I scream\n\"Who's afraid of little old me?\"\nI was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean\n\"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth\"\nWho's afraid of little old me?\nWell, you should be\n\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(You should be) You should be\n(You should be) You should be\nYou should be (You should be)\nYou should be (You should be)\nYou should be\n\n[Bridge]\nSo tell me everything is not about me\nBut what if it is?\nThen say they didn't do it to hurt me\nBut what if they did?\nI wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me\nYou wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me\nSo all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs\nI'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?\nThat I'll sue you if you step on my lawn\nThat I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong\nPut narcotics into all of my songs\nAnd that's why you're still singin' along\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street\nCrash the party like a record scratch as I scream\n\"Who's afraid of little old me?\"\nI was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean\n\"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth\"\nWho's afraid of little old me?\nWell, you should be\n\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(You should be) You should be\n(You should be) You should be\n'Cause you lured me (You should be)\nAnd you hurt me (You should be)\nAnd you taught me\n\n[Outro]\nYou caged me and then you called me crazy\nI am what I am 'cause you trained me\nSo who's afraid of me?\nWho's afraid of little old me?\nWho's afraid of little old me?",

    "lyrics": "[Intro]\nHello, what's wrong?\nAh, nothing, no, it's stupid\nYou wouldn't really—\nNah, you're good man, go ahead\nIt's just that blue-eyed people get all of the good compliments\nAnd I have brown eyes\nI don't really get any—\n\n[Verse 1]\nYour eyes are like dirt (Dirt?)\nHold on, I mean that as a compliment\n'Cause dirt's the source of food and life\nIn every single continent\nThey sparkle like topaz\nThe stars could never parallel\nThey look so sweet\nLike coffee filled with caramel\nThat's pretty sweet\nAnd like the autumn leaves\nThat fall from all the trees\nThe colors in your eyes\nAren't as loved as they ought to be\nThe warmth inside of them\nMatches the heart inside of me\nIt's like it's meant to be (Wow!)\n\n\n[Break]\nSee, brown eyes can be beautiful too\nIt's all about loving truly what was given to you\nBut, I'm sure you want to know if I can do it\nIf I'm able, what would I say if they were hazel?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour eyes have a little bit of everything\nWell, yeah, obviously\nAnd I'd rather have a jack of all\nThan a master of one\nYour eyes hold true surprise\nA single color's no fun\nThey are second to none\nAnd they dance in the sun\nAnd the one thing I remember\nAbout eyes like yours\nIs I can go sifting through them\nEvery time I'm bored\nTo find nuggets of gold\nLike in the California rivers\nIf you ever need a gift\nA hazel eye is going to deliver\n\n[Break]\nWoah, shivers\nThose eyes are winners too\nIt's almost like your eyes are something\nUnique just to you\nBut I know your mind is wandering\nAs you become serene\nWhat would I say if they were green?\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nYour eyes shine like emeralds in the light (Yeah?)\nThey resemble lovely sights (Of?)\nFireflies glowing bright\nAnd warming up the night (Aw)\nAn attempt to match their vibrance\nIs a fail on every try\nWith eyes like four-leaf clovers\nKnow that luck is by your side\nBecause the odds of having eyes\nWith Mother Nature's favorite color\nIs a feat that's so rare\nYou'd be shocked to find another\nSo whenever you think green is super icky, or it sucks\nJust remember that in nature\nIt's a healthy sign of love\n\n[Break]\nSee? Duh, every eye has magic\nHidden in the iris that's woven tight like fabric\nOf course, you're not convinced yet\nYou must know what I'd do\nWhat would I say if they were blue?\n\n[Verse 4]\nYour eyes are like diamonds (That's cheesy)\nYou're right, that's easy\nAnd comparing to the sky or ocean waves\nWould feel like cheating\n'Cause your eyes are so much more than that\nThere must be deeper meaning\n'Cause your gaze feels like a home\nI could stay without ever leaving\nThey are calm but bold, warm but cold\nWith little flecks of green\nAnd maybe little flecks of gold\nThey are windows to the soul\nAnd your soul is something special\nSee, your eyes are just a glimpse\nOf the beauty inside your vessel\n\n\n[Break]\nWow, and true beauty there is\nFound outside and from beauty within\nAnd you don't even have to ask\nHow I think I would react\nIf your eyes were so dark they looked black\n\n[Verse 5]\nYour eyes are like the boldest of obsidian (Like the rock?)\nNo, like the glass from a volcano\nThat could blow you to oblivion\nIt's like one in a million\nNow you're basking in the glory\nYour eyes are pools of ink\nThat could tell like a thousand stories\nYour eyes aren't empty\nThat's far from the truth\nSpace looks empty too\nUntil you get a better view\nThe night is in your eyes\nThe universe is part of you\nIf only you could see yourself\nHow other people do\n\n[Break]\nPhew, I won't lie\nWhat a crazy journey\nBut it isn't finished yet\nThere's still a color that's yearning\nSo join me in this moment\nThere's no need for more delay\nWhat would I say if they were gray?\n\n[Verse 6]\nYour eyes remind me of the moon (No way)\nIt's true! They're the light inside the dark\nAnd change the tide when they're in view\nThe dark being the world\nThe tide being my mood\nYour eyes blow me away\nLike hurricanes and monsoons\nI knew the moment\nThat I met your gaze of steel\nThat your eyes were holding stories\nThat may never be revealed\nThey are fierce at first\nAnd you may think that's not ideal\nBut I hope you come to learn\nThe comfort that you make others feel\n\n[Outro]\nHooray! I think we're finally done\nA simple song for every eye\nThat's shining in the sun\nEven after this, I'm sure\nI've probably missed a few\nBut I hope by now we've learned\nThat the beauty's inside of you",

    "lyrics": "The Velvet Underground & Nico album came out in 1967 amid the hippie revolution in the summer of love. The Velvet’s were disillusioned with these ideas and presented a darker side of things, one that was diametrically opposed to the popular counterculture movement of the time. They laid the foundation for punk and glam rock, and even influenced electronic music movements. The Velvet Underground were able to demystify the sexual freedom and the drug culture of the 1960’s through matter of fact observations of New York street life that served as the antithesis to the West Coast feel good vibe and in doing so, created one of the most influential, prophetic albums of all time that expressed an alienation not being represented in popular culture before them\n\nThe Velvet Underground were a quintessentially New York band. They embodied the streets they knew in every way. They wrote songs about real things that they saw, and they certainly saw some interesting things during their time with Andy Warhol’s eclectic gang of outcasts. Their peers consisted of artists, junkies, homosexuals, and transvestites. Like Andy Warhol’s pop art, their music was “anti-art made by anti-art elitists” (Heylin XI). They were one of the first rock and roll bands who had no chance of reaching a mass audience because they clashed so deeply with much of society’s foundations. Their music was intellectual but they weren’t intellectual 'elitists' in the traditional sense of the word. They took inspiration from trashy paperback novels rather than the widely regarded literary classics\n\nThe first track, Sunday Morning, is the most delicate on the album and the last to be recorded. It’s really the only track that aims to be beautiful, and is. It’s a sort of precursory reminder to the audience that the cacophony and noise about to come is intentional; it isn't stemming from a lack of musical skill or knowledge. This sort of attitude is what the whole punk movement was based upon, but the punks adapted an attitude that preexisting musical knowledge wasn’t necessary. The attitude and the ideas behind the song are what really matters, and this is what the Velvet Underground served on their debut album. With the opening number, their softest track, they prove that they weren’t relying solely on shock appeal and a confrontational attitude. ‘Sunday Morning’ represents the calm before the storm and it is unclear whether the song is first or last in chronological order of the album. The song contains the most commercial sound on the album but also somber lyrics. It reads like a peaceful Sunday morning after a long, hard week in New York City. Though not overt or as confrontational as the rest of the songs, it shows their multiple personalities. One when they are relatively sober, albeit coming down as he sings “Sunday morning and I’m falling down.” The album takes no moral stance on all of the crazy things they’ve seen in the streets and been a part of; but they represent real things going on and not a dream world where everything is always fine. Some of these things are hard to confront as Reed sings “I’ve got a feeling I don’t want to know.” This could be about what happened or what’s about to happen throughout the album. It recognizes that, although the album consists of a series of vignettes representative of NY street culture, all of the stories aren’t completely contained within the album. It doesn’t manage to tie everything up in a neat way. There are stories from before the album and after that are parts of the same narrative but the audience won't be let in on them\n\nThe Velvet Underground were used to deep alienation beyond the normal level. Even within the biggest counter-cultural movement in American history going on, they couldn’t (or didn’t want to) find a place within a larger cross-section of American culture. The only place they seemed to fit in was with Andy Warhol’s factory crowd, a self-described group of misfits. Instead of going on along with the hippies rebelling against post-war conformity and conservatism in the 1950’s, they pushed the boundaries even further than the hippies out west and intentionally made people feel uncomfortable. Hippie music became popular and eventually co-opted by the mainstream like every other large cultural movement before and after (Jazz, Blues, Punk, Hip-Hop etc.). The Velvet’s pushed the boundaries about as far as they could be pushed, nothing was off limits. Subject matter was real and dark, portraying the seedier side of New York and America as a whole. Instead of singing specifically about equality in race relations, racial issues are subtly brought up within the narrative of the songs that feel deeply rooted in the New York that Reed was living in. In ‘I’m Waiting For The Man’ he sings “hey white boy, what you doing up town?” The rest of the lines around it are unclear what the narrator of the song actually is doing uptown sparking much debate as to if it’s as straight forward as it first appears, that the narrator is looking to buy ‘smack.’ Another popular interpretation is that ‘the man’ of the song was actually a homosexual lover of the narrator. This theory comes from the lines where the narrator is asked “hey white boy, you chasin’ our women around?” and he responds “oh pardon me sir, it’s the furthest thing from my mind, I’m just looking for a dear, dear friend of mine.” This dear friend of his may have been more than someone that just sold him narcotics. Reed wasn’t writing these songs as a peace activist or even outwardly promoting equality like the West Coast was fond of. He provides a succinct, but ultimately telling story of race relations in New York City in a nonchalant, conversational tone. The song is set in Harlem, a predominately African-American community, and the tone in which the narrator is addressed suggests that he, a white man, has no business being there, thus is up to no good. He’s looking for something that needs to be hidden from mainstream white society, whether it be drugs or unconventional sexuality. Here, he takes no explicit position, like in ‘Heroin,’ but establishes the setting with a gritty realism and doesn’t try to hide what’s really going on in the neighborhoods of America. He’s not trying to sell anything, but he does tell the story of an underrepresented class of people in America whose issues had been largely ignored. Reed has no qualms about calling it like it is\n\nThis deep cultural alienation can inevitably lead to drug use, and sometimes abuse, when a certain sect of society is ignored or marginalized. The Velvet Underground understood this and with Reed’s lyrics and the backing instrumentation, these groups of alienated people are addressed. While the west coast largely advocated drug use, especially LSD by groups such as Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead, The Velvet Underground made music about drugs, and inspired by drugs but didn’t ostensibly advocate their use.  This is a key difference between the two coasts; the Velvets understood that drugs were an escape, one which some people found necessary to modern life. Not everyone took them to party or have a good time. Hardcore drug users need the drugs because the life they perceive is so bad that something drastic is needed to violently shake them from that world. Reed addresses the issues that lead to drug abuse within ‘Heroin’ and also cedes that “when the smack begins to flow,” he “just doesn’t care anymore” and it makes him “feel like a man.” The whole song is a musical representation of what shooting heroin feels like to the user. While there is no endorsement or denouncement, the first verse is certainly the most joyful section of the song. It opens with a singular guitar, with a very calm riff hat slowly builds with added instrumentation layered on top of each other. The drums follow the heartbeat of the user, starting off steady and once the heroin is injected, it becomes much more frantic and erratic. Around the five minute mark, the screeching viola reaches a pinnacle with the heartbeat drums driving forward faster and faster almost drowning out Reed’s vocals, perhaps signifying that the drug doesn’t allow the mind’s thoughts to fully come through and they are distorted through the lens of the drug\n\nThe Velvet Underground and the hippies both used and sang about drugs, but their approaches were completely different. Lou Reed sings in ‘Heroin’ that it makes him feel like “Jesus’ son.” He acknowledges that the drug obviously makes the user feel powerful while also making a slight jab at Christianity and the idea that Jesus was actually married to Mary Magdalene and fathered children with her. Heroin is an escape for the user and the lyrics acknowledge this when they say “when the heroin is in my blood, and that blood is in my head, thank God I’m as good as dead, and thank your God that I’m not aware, and thank God that I just don’t care.” There is another shot at religion with “your God” and it reveals the desperation that heroin users face, and the mindset that leads to drug addiction, to get away from the world that we live in and temporarily escape to a place where there are no “jim jims” or “politicians making crazy sounds.” The ephemeral joys that the drug provides are just that, there is no end in sight. Lou Reed once said, “I take drugs just because, in the 20th century, in a technological age living in the city, there are certain drugs you have to take just to keep yourself normal like a caveman, just to bring yourself up or down.” He didn’t advocate using drugs or not, he is matter of fact about the way they feel and what causes him. It is just something you do to feel “normal” in his eyes. The music emulates the feelings of a drug user and goes up and down with the highs and lows. John Cale stated that the long vamps on two chords that droned on was “an attempt to control the unconscious with the hypnotic.”\n\nLou Reed, the main songwriter who shared vocal duties on the album with Nico, was not afraid of adverse reactions to his lyrics. He actually welcomed them and the inside sleeves of the album displayed some of the negative reviews the press had written about the shows, displaying that the band were “perversely proud of them” (Hogan 39). One of the major themes in Lou’s songwriting was sexuality, more specifically non-traditional sexual practices. The name for the band was drawn from a book published in 1963 by Michael Leigh called The Velvet Underground about paraphilia (intense sexual arousal to atypical objects, situations, or individuals) in the United States. They found the name “evocative of underground cinema” (Phoenix 1). The title seemed fit for the name of the band as they had already written the song ‘Venus in Furs’ based off the book by the same title. The word Sado-Masochism is derived from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the author of said book. The cover of The Velvet Underground book says “Here is an incredible book. It will shock and amaze you. But as a documentary on the sexual corruption of our age, it is a must for every thinking adult.” The band seemed to take this philosophy wholeheartedly into every facet of their music and their live shows\n\nThe fourth track of the album, ‘Venus in Furs’, is an adaptation of   Sacher-Masoch's 1870 novel into song form. Severin, the protagonist of the book is madly in love with Wanda von Dunajew, the novel’s central female character. He is so infatuated with her that he literally asks to be her slave and asks her to treat him as such, in increasingly degrading ways. The fourth line in the song, “strike dear mistress, and cure his heart” is seemingly directly from the novel. In the novel, Severin asks to be whipped hard by Wanda so he can be ‘cured’ of his severe infatuation to her but the abuse he receives only deepens his love and intensifies his extreme feelings and devotion. Sach-Masoch refers to this as “suprasensuality.” The more frequent and violently abused, the more devoted he became to his “mistress,” as she makes him refer to her as. The parallels between the novel and Reed’s own life are hard to ignore. Both the novel, and Lou’s childhood used extreme measures to ‘cure’ a perceived problem through harsh techniques. Lou’s deviant behavior, described as “homosexual tendencies,” was regarded as a mental illness in the 1960’s and he was ‘treated’ with electro-shock therapy which he later wrote about in ‘Kill Your Sons’ during his solo career (Hogan 6). In both cases, these techniques only brought about more suffering. Reed’s deviance wasn’t accepted by society or more importantly, by his family and this led to intense alienation which would later drive his work. The hippie mindset of peace and love wasn’t the reality Reed faced in the New York streets. There were real consequences for being different and doing something that most people didn’t approve of. Later in the song, Reed sings of “ermine furs” which “adorn the imperious.” While displaying his vast vocabulary and familiarity with obscure literature, he is able to vividly describe the imagery of the novel and stay true to the main components of the story, essentially poetically summarizing the novel. The use of “imperious” reinforces the dominatrix relationship while “ermine furs” strengthen the imagery of the scene that is being described while the musical ensemble is a “whips ‘n’ chains atmosphere called up by John Cale’s viola drones cut by slashes and Maureen Tucker’s slave master time keeping on kettle drum and tambourine” (Zak 57). The instrumentation allows the Velvets to explore areas that a novel can’t and portray the sinister and desperate situations described through the imagery of their ensemble\n\nThe main root of their drug use (and abuse) and sexual deviance was an intense sense of alienation.  They were in the fast paced east coast world that didn’t care about your feelings; it was about getting things done. Getting together and feeling alright was not on the agenda. This alienation led them down a path that no one in popular music had been down before. One of their main goals was to antagonize the audience, whether it was the audience at home listening to the record or the audience at the show. At their live shows, Andy Warhol movies would be playing in the background while the band wailed away on the guitars with feedback which “sounded like 12 million guitars going at one time with the amplified, intensified screeches that really hurt the eardrums” (Heylin 43). The goal was to create an atmosphere that was uncharted territory and pushed the audience passed their limits. Warhol said about the pictures that played behind them, “if the audience can take it for ten minutes, I show it for fifteen minutes” (Heylin 49). The effect was to disorient the audience and leave them “too stunned to think or say anything or give any kind of opinion” (Heylin 45). They struck chords deep within people that made them think about what it truly means to be alive. These songs weren’t mindless pop tunes to wash over the listener and make them feel safe or momentarily give them pleasure, but they brought out the raw emotions that lay deep within and forced the listener to at least consider an alternative, at times being so radical that they wouldn’t even know how to react. This approach was obviously not popular with the masses and at their shows most of the audience would end up leaving early with about ninety percent of the remaining spectators were “hostile to the show” (Heylin 48)\nRalph J Gleason, a respected critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, described their performance nothing more than a bad condensation of all the bum trips of the Trips Festival. He reportedly pulled the plug when they left the stage with their guitars leaning on the amps to create a “squalor of electronic noise” (Schindler & Schwartz 315). They also did this to Bill Graham at another show in San Francisco and set about smashing Morrison’s drum kit after their set with the amps still blaring. He confronted them after the show and they brushed him off; they later said he was muttering something about “insurance reasons” as Reed was injured from a flying cymbal to his head and was bleeding profusely after the chaotic destruction. This is not to say that all of California was against them, but many prominent hippies were. They actually had a stronger following in California than any other state probably because they antagonized the hippies and anyone that felt alienated by the hippie movement could listen to the group that defined alienation. The Velvet's music and performances were dark and abrasive. The Grateful Dead and other San Francisco Sound bands focused on beautiful melodies where the Velvets focused on long droning noises composed of vamps on one or two chords. Maureen Tucker called the Dead the “most boring band” she’d ever heard while Lou Reed said their music was “tedious, a lie, and untalented” (Jovanic 85)\n\nThe Velvet Underground remained a shape shifting, and ultimately widely influential band that came from the bottoms of the society and completely represented that through their art. They made music about drugs, not-traditional sexual practices, and other issues of modern life that were rooted in a sense of alienation from the major countercultural narrative of the 1960’s. Even with the recent passing of primary songwriter Lou Reed, their direct influence lives on in popular bands such as The Strokes and Arctic Monkeys and with the advent of the internet, their legacy has a potential to continue to spread for the foreseeable future\n\n\n\nBibliography\nHeylin, Clinton.

It's a cinch!\nIt could practically write itself--\nAnd let's pray it does, cause as I may have mentioned\nI have no clue what I'm doing\n\nAm I insane? This is what I've been waiting for\nWell that, plus the screaming of ten angry editors\nA girl? It's a girl! How the hell?

Wait, corrupts!?\nAbsolutely, that is genius!\nBut give me some time, I'll be twice as good as that six months from never\nJust look around at the world we're inheriting\nAnd think of the one we'll create\nTheir mistake is they got old, that is not a mistake we'll be making\nNo sir, we'll stay young forever!\nGive those kids and me the brand new century and watch what happens\nIt's David and Goliath, do or die\nThe fight is on and I can't watch what happens\n\nBut all I know is nothing happens if you just give in\nIt can't be any worse than how it's been\nAnd it just so happens that we just might win\nSo whatever happens!

Nah, courageous balls\nHad to change my style\nThey said I'm way too soft and I sound like AZ and Nas\nOut came the claws and the fangs been out since then\nBut up until the instant that I went against it\nIt was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought\nNo wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught\n\"Do I really belong in this game?\" I pondered\nI just wanna play my part\nShould I make waves or not? So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on\nAnd I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the art form I was raised upon\nBut sometimes you gotta take a loss and have people rub it in your face\nBefore you get made pissed off\nAnd keep plugging, it's your only outlet, and your only outfit\nSo you know they gonna talk about it, better find a way to counter it quick\nAnd make it—, ah\nFeel like I've already said this a ka-billion eighty times\nHow many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?\nWhat I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story\nBet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to—\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Sia & Eminem]\nI was a—, afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found (My dreams)\nI didn't wanna go another round (Yeah)\nAn angry man's power will shut you up (Agh)\nAnd trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Sia]\nGuts over fear (The time is near)\nGuts over fear (Might shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me 'round\nI let you keep me down (Now, I got)\nGuts over fear, guts over fear\n\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nFeels like a close, it's comin' to\nFuck am I gonna do?\nIt's too late to start over\nThis is the only thing I—, thing I know\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI know what it was like, I was there once\nSingle parents, hate your appearance\nDid you struggle to find your place in this world?\nAnd the pain spawns all the anger on\nBut it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song\nLearned who to aim it on, that I made a spark\nStarted to spit harder shit, learned how to harness it while the reins were off\nAnd there was a lot of bizarre shit\nBut the crazy part was soon as I stopped sayin' I gave a fuck\nHaters started to appreciate my art\nAnd it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused\nBut what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?\nAnd the lights go out in that trailer park? (Oh)\nAnd the window is closin', and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows, and I'm frozen\n'Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from\nJust a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun\nSo, to the break of dawn, here I go recyclin' the same old song\nBut I'd rather make Not Afraid two\nThan make another motherfuckin' We Made You, ah\nNow, I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs\nMy demise and my uprise, pray to God\nI just open enough eyes later on and gave you the supplies and the tools\nTo hopefully use that'll make you strong enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt\n'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt\nJust havin' to balance my dang self\nWhen on eggshells, I was made to walk\nBut thank you, Ma, 'cause that gave me the\nStrength to cause Shady-mania\nSo when they empty that stadium\nLeast I made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done\nSo this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just gettin' accepted\nI represent him or her, anyone similar\nYou are the reason that I made this song\nAnd everything you're scared to say, don't be afraid to say no more\nFrom this day forward, just let them a-holes talk, take it with a grain of salt\nAnd eat their fuckin' faces off\nThe legend of the angry blond lives on through you when I'm gone\nAnd to think I was a—\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Sia & Eminem]\nI was a—, afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found (My dreams)\nI didn't wanna go another round (Yeah)\nAn angry man's power will shut you up (Agh)\nAnd trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Sia]\nGuts over fear (The time is near)\nGuts over fear (Might shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me 'round\nI let you keep me down (Now, I got)\nGuts over fear, guts over fear",

Is it love?\nWhat's more wrong - that I too wish to be great\nOr my mother wished she'd had a son?\nAnd even if I can't be the one\nMaybe I could at least help make way for him\nUntil the day that he comes\nMaybe my name could also be known\nThat I helped return good to the people\nAnd restored greatness to Rome\n[Bridge]\nBrutus, Brutus, Brutus, Brutus\nBrutus, Brutus, Brutus, Brutus\nBrutus, Brutus, Brutus, Brutus\nBrutus, Brutus, Brutus, Brutus\n\n[Verse 4]\nMy name is Brutus and my name means heavy\nSo with a heavy heart I'll guide this dagger\nInto the heart of my enemy\nMy whole life, you were a teacher and friend to me\nPlease know my actions are not motivated only by envy\nI too have a destiny\nThis death will be art\nThe people will speak of this day from near and afar\nThis event will be history\nAnd I'll be great too\nI don't want what you have\nI wanna be you\n\n\n[Outro]\nI always knew I could be the one\nThough I feel the endless pain of being\nAnd I am scorched by the sun\nOf humble origins and born of the cursed sex\nMy name is Brutus, but the people will call me Rex",

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI walked through the door with you, the air was cold\nBut somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Causе there we arе again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\nAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love,\" you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\nRunnin' scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\nI'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\n\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin' in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin' me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it (All too well)\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it",

Han kysser sin kæreste fra skolen\nI solen foran en købmandsbutik med ophørsudsalg\nHylderne bugner med guldkorn i udvalg\nF.eks. den om gamle dage\nOg hvor respekten kommer fra\nDet var dengang en hver fik lov at lære at dyrke haver\nSå måtte man lære en hel del om livet\nOg luge forsigtigt og ikke træde ned\nOg aflede stære fra een jordbærbed osv\nNu la'r man mest indkørslerne asfaltere\nDer er ikke meget fodbold på plænerne mere\nDEt er studsing og skrårem og motorsav reklameblade\n\nSlingrer ned ad vestergade\n\nDer er en masse tomme huse\nOG en masse uden boliger\nMod centrum hvor det hele blir\nUroligere og uroligere\nOg bannere med lapper på\nOg laset tøj og stribet hår\nOg dig der lukker øjnene\nFor alt det som du ikke forstår...\n\n\nSlingrer ned ad vestergade\n\nEt underligt grønt land\nMed masser af blåt vand\nEn lan een med næse og øer\nOg hunde der gøer\nOg køer der muher\nOg duer der kvidrer osv\nOg mennesker som nogen gange fortyder\nSå lidt liv vi i grunden nyder\nNår vi en sjælden gang ser igennem tågen hvad det er\nDet drejer sig om her\nDet er\nFravær, fravær, fravær, fravær\n\nSlingrer ned ad vestergade",

You think I'm cute\nYou think I wouldn't never, ever say boo\nYou think I'm petty? You think I'm weak\nYou think I should be seen but shouldn't speak?\nYou think I'm angry? You're fucking right\nI'm sick and tired, always running from the fight\nYou think I'm loose? Shame on you\nI'll cut you off before you know that you're old news\n\n[Chorus: Theresa Jarvis]\nSo get the fuck out my face\nI'm trying to think\nGet the fuck out my face\nI'm not part of your clique\nAll you do is talk, talk, talk\nBut you never, ever listen\nSo get the fuck out my face\nBefore I do something\n\n\n[Verse 2: Jason Aalon]\nHow did you think I wasn't gon' get mine\nBy any means necessary while y'all just waste time?\nI ain't even hit my prime yet, all y'all declining\nWell, I'm struggling to find a reason to give a shit, oh\n'Cause everything you say sound like a complaint\nShit don't work out because you ain't never pulled your weight\nSo blessed is the day I get the chance to say\nGet the fuck up out my face\n\n[Chorus: Theresa Jarvis]\nSo get the fuck out my face\nI'm trying to think\nGet the fuck out my face\nI'm not part of your clique\nAll you do is talk, talk, talk\nBut you never, ever listen\nSo get the fuck out my face\nBefore I do something\n\n[Verse 3: Theresa Jarvis]\nI'ma do something crazy if you talk to me again\nDo something crazy, baby, I am not your friend\nDon't get me in trouble, now let's not pretend\nThat you're the good guy and I just lost my patience\nSpent twenty years being talked down to\nNow I ain't breaking down, no, especially not for you\nI'm a big girl now, I got big girl shoes\nI don't need no validation so fuck you",

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nElope with me Ms. Private and we'll sail around the world\nI will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl\nHow many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take\nHow many nights of limping round on pagan holidays\nOh, elope with me in private and we'll set something ablaze\nA trail for the devil to erase\n\n[Verse 2]\nSan Francisco's calling us, the Giants and Mets will play\nPiazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay\nWe hung about the stadium, we've got no place to stay\nWe hung about the Tenderloin and tenderly you tell\nAbout the saddest book you ever read\nIt always makes you cry\nThe statue's crying too and well he may\n\n[Verse 3]\nI love you, I've a drowning grip on your adoring face\nI love you, my responsibility has found a place\nBeside you and strong warnings in the guise of gentle words\nCome wave upon me from the family wider net absurd\nYou'll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job\nMaybe, but not what she deserves\n\n[Verse 4]\nElope with me Miss Private and we'll drink ourselves awake\nWe'll taste the coffee houses and award certificates\nA privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style\nWe'll comment on the decor and we'll help the passerby\nAnd at dusk when work is over we'll continue the debate\nIn a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare\n\n\n[Verse 5]\nThe catcher hits for .318 and catches every day\nThe pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays\nHe goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor\nHe knows the drink affects his speed he's praying for a doorway\nBack into the life he wants and the confession of the bench\nLife outside the diamond is a wrench\n\n[Verse 6]\nI wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend\nI know it wouldn't come to love, my heroine pretend\nA lady stepping from the songs we love until this day\nYou'd settle for an epitaph like, \"Walk Away, Renee\"\nThe sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like a flower\nMeet you at the statue in an hour\nMeet you at the statue in an hour",

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHow can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?\nHow come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?\nWe're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down\nBy puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow\nWhen I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind\nSoaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine\nThey say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice\nAnd yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')\nTo keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')\nBut the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I hope I learn to get over myself\nStop tryin' to be somebody else\nSo we can love each other for free\nEverybody wants somethin', you just want me\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?\nWhy am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?\nIn these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to\n'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou better believe for you, I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)\nHigh tides (High tides, high tides)\n'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I hope I learn to get over myself\nStop tryin' to be somebody else\nOh, I just want to love you, love you for free\nEverybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me\n\n[Bridge]\nListen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get\nYou get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left\nOh, I hope in time (Hope in time)\nWe both will find peace of mind (We both find)\nSometimes, the road less travelled is a road best left behind\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, I hope I learn to get over myself\nStop tryin' to be somebody else\nOh, I just want to love you, love you for free, yeah\n'Cause everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me\n\n[Refrain]\nYou better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')\nTo keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')\nBut the higher we climb, feels like we're both none the wiser\n\n\n[Outro]\nThe only regret I have\nI wish that it was just at a different time\nA most turbulent period of my life\nWhy would I put that on you?\nThat's just, like, a very heavy thing to have to talk about\nBut because of that period of time\nEven though it was so much fun\nI didn't get to go on and make new memories with him\nThere was just memories in a big storm",
